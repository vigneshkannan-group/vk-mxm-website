Welcome! We are a growing team of undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral scientists and engineers, who study **materials and structures under extreme conditions of stress, strain rate and multi-physical fields, at short time scales**, within the <a href="https://lms.ip-paris.fr/" target="_blank">Solid Mechanics Laboratory (LMS), Department of Mechanics</a> at the Ecole Polytechnique in France. 

Our primary tools of choice to study these problems are experimental. We use mechanical design, electronic and optical instrumentation to push the cutting edge of studying materials and structures down to time scales of nanoseconds, and length scales from the macroscopic down to micrometers. 

Our experiments allow us to "see" the wondrous complexity of nature, but to comprehend this complexity we need models. We enjoy working with mathematical modelers to help understand complex phenomena, and hope to become amateur modelers some day! ​​​We hope you have fun reading about our work, and learn something in the process. If you would like to work with our team, know more about us, or teach us something more, please feel free to reach out. We are always looking for new perspectives to our way of thinking! <a href="team.qmd" target="_blank">Find out who we are!</a>
