Congratulations to Tamar Tsikarishvili on completing her Bachelor Thesis defence! Tamar spent 10 weeks working on a new design for a dynamic shear experiment (a Torsional Kolsky bar). She performed admirably, and passed her defense with flying colors. 
Tamar is now exploring new waters literally! She is about to start a Nordic masters program in Maritime Engineering. While we are sad to see her go, we wish her great success in her future endeavors!
