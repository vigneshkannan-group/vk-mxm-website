I am developing a new program at the LMS to investigate the kinetics of phase transformations in a wide range of shape memory alloys (SMAs) under large multi-axial stress states and very short time scales. Development of dynamic, high-resolution experiments with multi-physical coupling is ongoing in the lab -- with a lot of excitement! We eventually hope to discover the mechanisms behind such complex dynamic phenomena -- one direction towards our broad goal of discovering micromechanics of defects under extreme conditions.
