We are excited by scientific problems that require us to push the limits of quantitative measurements across length and time scales. We develop specialized experiments for mechanics and multi-physics problems at short time scales. Examples involve miniature Kolsky bars (high strain rate impact), high-speed optical microscopy and interferometry, multi-scale electro-mechanical test beds, and pump-probe acoustic spectroscopy. Current and future directions will extend these capabilities to study transient material response under complex stress states with multi-physical coupling.
