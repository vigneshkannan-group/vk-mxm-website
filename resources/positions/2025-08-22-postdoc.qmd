### Post-doctoral scientist position

We are looking for a motivated and passionate post-doctoral scientist in the area of experimental mechanics and dynamic behavior of materials. You will lead an effort to study phase transformations under multi-axial stress states across a wide range of strain rates -- spanning quasi-static to high-strain-rate dynamic loading conditions. This will involve the development of multi-axial quasi-static, and dynamic compression-tension-torsion experiments towards the discovery of phase transformation kinetics. 

Does this excite you? Then please do apply! In case of questions, please feel free to contact me at [vignesh.kannan@polytechnique.edu](vignesh.kannan@polytechnique.edu).
