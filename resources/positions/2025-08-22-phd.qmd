### PhD position

We are looking for a motivated and passionate doctoral candidate in the area of experimental mechanics and dynamic behavior of materials. The PhD thesis will focus on dynamic phase transformations under large mechanical stresses and coupled multiphysical fields. The student will develop dynamic impact experiments, multi-physical test benches and high-speed instrumentation towards the discovery of phase transformation kinetics at short time scales.
