You will lead an effort to study phase transformations under multi-axial stress states across a wide range of strain rates – spanning quasi-static to high-strain-rate dynamic loading conditions. This will involve the development of multi-axial quasi-static, and dynamic compression-tension-torsion experiments towards the discovery of phase transformation kinetics.\nDoes this excite you?

    "text": "We are excited by scientific problems that require us to push the limits of quantitative measurements across length and time scales. We develop specialized experiments for mechanics and multi-physics problems at short time scales. Examples involve miniature Kolsky bars (high strain rate impact), high-speed optical microscopy and interferometry, multi-scale electro-mechanical test beds, and pump-probe acoustic spectroscopy. Current and future directions will extend these capabilities to study transient material response under complex stress states with multi-physical coupling."

    "text": "Ferroelectrics are a class of electro-active materials, ubiquitous across a wide range of technological applications e.g., energy harvesting, sensors & transducers, nano-electronics and active structures. At the core of these multi-functional applications is the coupling between electrical, mechanical and thermal fields. Microscopically, this manifests as the heterogeneous evolution of volume defects called “domains”, separated by planar defects called “domain walls”. Our efforts focus on understanding these dissipative kinetics, their effects on electro-mechanical switching and dynamic viscolelasticity in ferroelectric ceramics and crystals.\nCollaborators: Prof. Dennis M. Kochmann (ETH), Prof. Morgan Trassin (ETH), Dr. Claire Griesbach (ETH)"
